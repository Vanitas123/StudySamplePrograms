	Ritik and Jumping (100 Marks)
	Ritik loves to jump here and there.So his friend Sugam gave him an array of N Integers in which he can choose any pair of Integers Ai and Aj if and only if i+K=j. Now he can add 1 to one of those elements and subtract one from the other i.e move 1 from one element to the other.He can perform this operation any number of times by jumping here and there in the array.
	Now Ritik wants to know if he can make all the numbers Prime by jumping and performing 0 or more number of given operations on the array.
	Note : 0 and 1 are not considered as prime numbers.
	
	Input Format
	The first line of input contains an Integer K.
	The Second line of input contains an Integer N denoting the size of Array. 
	Next line contains elements of the array A separated by whitespaces.
	
	Constraints
	1 <= K <= N
	1 <= N <= 10000
	1 <= i <= N 
	1 <= Ai <= 100
	
	
	Output Format
	You must print 1 as answer if it possible to make all numbers as prime and -1 if not.
