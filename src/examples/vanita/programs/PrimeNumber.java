	 * 
	 * 1) The only even prime number is 2. All other even numbers can be divided by
	 * 2 and hence they are not prime numbers.
	 * 
	 * 2) Every composite number has at least one prime factor less than or equal to
	 * square root of itself.
	 * 
	 * In other words, the smallest prime factor of a composite number N is always
	 * less than or equal to âˆšN.
